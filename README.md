# Asteroids (Experimental Prototype)

**A simple Asteroids-style game built with Python and Pygame.**

---

## 📌 Description

This project is a **learning prototype / proof of concept** inspired by the classic Asteroids arcade game.  
It includes basic spaceship movement, shooting, and asteroid collisions.  

⚠️ Expect **rough edges, placeholder art, and minimal polish** — this is a work-in-progress demo rather than a full game.
